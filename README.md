# The Quick Terrain Generator

## Application Fact Sheet
**Purpose**

World building is a long and complex task that usually requires a whole team and many hours to complete. This covers aspects such as designing terrain features such as hills and valleys, populating the land with plants and trees as well as lighting and atmosphere settings that match the theme of the place. The aim of this project is to bring a quick, easy to use solution for creating these environments to the young generation of developers who are struggling with this first step of game development, allowing them the foothold they need to explore and ultimately enjoy their hobby further.

**Functionality**

By taking inspiration and techniques from games that generate their terrains procedurally (such as Minecraft) this project utilises complex mathematical functions such as Perlin noise to create "maps" that determine aspects of the terrain that will be produced. 
Aspects include
 - Smoothly plotting nodes that terrain pieces will connect to
 - Mapping out foliage clusters to create realistic areas of high and low density trees

These aspects are further modified by the type of environment that the user is creating. For example, forests have hills and deep valleys with lots of trees in different densities, whereas a the long rolling dunes of the desert are sparsely populated with cacti.

With all of this functionality, it was a big task to maintain a good user-friendly front end that still allows for full usage of the project, but has been done by using a small settings panel with clear labels and inputs.
